As per definition, APY takes into account the effect of compounding interest. However, the rewards you get from Hedera native staking don’t compound automatically.

In addition to that, I noticed that during the COVID-19 pandemic some people were perceiving a growing gap between what they called ‘mainstream media’ and other media sources. I wanted to create a news platform that is accessible in all countries and that closes the gap between ‘mainstream media’ and other writers.
